        Fafda served with papaya sambharo and besan chutney is an awesome combination. To make fafda you donâ€™t need many ingredients. Generally, papad khar is used in making fafda. But since papad khar is not easily available I have used baking soda.

        Fafda with papaya sambharo and fried green chilies is one of our favorite breakfast. In Mumbai occasionally during weekends, I would buy fafda and the chutneys with some jalebis from a Gujarati snack shop, close to our home.

       <dd>
        During that period I was working in the corporate sector and never had the time to make such elaborate breakfast at home. But now I have some time on hand to make elaborate recipes as well as try and test different recipes.

       <dd>
        In Gujarat, during Dussehra festival fafda along with papaya chutney, fafda chutney and jalebi is sold like hot cakes. Making these at home is also not difficult. I find it quite easy and with this recipe you can make crispy, crunchy munchy Fafda without any hassle

        Serve fafda warm or at room temperature with some fried green chilies, raw papaya sambaro and besan chutney. You can also serve with Gujarati besan kadhi.

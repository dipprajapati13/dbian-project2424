        Fafda served with papaya sambharo and besan chutney is an awesome combination. To make fafda you donâ€™t need many ingredients. Generally, papad khar is used in making fafda. But since papad khar is not easily available I have used baking soda.

        Fafda with papaya sambharo and fried green chilies is one of our favorite breakfast. In Mumbai occasionally during weekends, I would buy fafda and the chutneys with some jalebis from a Gujarati snack shop, close to our home.

       <dd>
        During that period I was working in the corporate sector and never had the time to make such elaborate breakfast at home. But now I have some time on hand to make elaborate recipes as well as try and test different recipes.

       <br>
       <dd>
        In Gujarat, during Dussehra festival fafda along with papaya chutney, fafda chutney and jalebi is sold like hot cakes. Making these at home is also not difficult. I find it quite easy and with this recipe you can make crispy, crunchy munchy Fafda without any hassle

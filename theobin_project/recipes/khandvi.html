       <dt>Step 1:- Sieve besan & prepare ginger-green chilli paste</dt>
       <br>
       <dd>
        Take a glass bowl and sieve besan. Remove the seeds of green chillies and prepare ginger and green chilli paste.

       <dt>Step 2:- Prepare the Khandvi batter
    </dt>
    
       <br>
       <dd>
        Grease the reverse side of a stainless steel thali or marble tabletop with a little oil to prevent the khandvi mixture from sticking and to ease the process of rolling the Khandvi. Mix the besan with ginger-green chilli paste, salt, turmeric powder, lemon juice and buttermilk. Take care that no lumps are formed.
       </dd><br> <dt>Step 3:- Cook the Khandvi batter in a pan & spread over greased surface</dt>
       <br>
       <dd>
        In a thick bottomed pan, cook this mixture by stirring continuously, till it becomes a smooth thick batter. It takes a few minutes to get this ready. Quickly spread long and thin portions of the mixture over the oiled inverted thali or marble tabletop as thinly as possible while the batter is still very hot.
       </dd><br> <dt>Step 4:-Cut into strips, roll tightly, prepare the tempering & pour it over the khandvi</dt>
       <br>
       <dd>
        When cool, cut into strips two inches wide and roll them tightly and taking care that you don't break them. Heat two tablespoons of oil and add a pinch of asafoetida and mustard seeds. When they crackle/splutter, pour over the pieces.
       </dd>
